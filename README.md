# Gift Bundle Discovery


Using transaction data from a giftware retailer, this project applies market basket analysis to discover common product associations. The goal is to find info for product bundling and cross-selling strategies.

AI usage: Originally I wrote an answer to all the tasks myself, but ultimately decided to polish the wording with AI (I had an issue where if I wrote a word similar to estonian it would auto correct it into estonian, similar with auto capitalization). I made sure to re-check every field the AI changed something in and if there was a need I re-wrote it to fit my project and goals.
